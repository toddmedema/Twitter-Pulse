TODO
timing on chart+data still glitchy
- perhaps don't update the chart by TWITTER?
use tweet timing data to generate historical info
give user the option to view graph at multiple scales

make buttons, etc bigger on small displays
ability to show + hide trending topics on mobile
ability to (or background?) refresh of trending?

Two view modes for Tweets - "live stream" and "click to view more"

Dream:
Have links in tweets be actual links
Other analytics/visualizations like % of each term that shows up in cross-search tweets?

animate tps graph instead of complete redraw
- would need to handle re-scales somehow
