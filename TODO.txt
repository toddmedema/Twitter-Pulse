TODO

on read mode, add refresh button
- on stream mode, remove refresh button
code refresh button! (basically immediately add
    max_tweets to UI)

use icon font for + search, refresh button

Get domain, re-brand

Two view modes for Tweets - "live stream" and "click to view more"
- mixpanel track

BUG:
if the page is created small, won't align when enlarged

Homepage explaining what it does?

give user the option to view graph at multiple scales

make buttons, etc bigger on small displays

let users filter (ie "show only tweets that contain" then
    a checkmark list of all tweet searches)
    - will need to restructure tweet storage so that
        tweet content isn't deleted once displayed
    - might also enable other analytics like
        "related terms"

Other analytics/visualizations like % of each term that shows up in cross-search tweets?

One use: monitor total conversation traffic about
        diff topics

Dream:
use tweet timing data to generate historical info
Have links in tweets be actual links
ability to show + hide trending topics on mobile

animate tps graph instead of complete redraw
- would need to handle re-scales somehow
