TODO
let users filter (ie "show only tweets that contain" then
    a checkmark list of all tweet searches)
    - might also enable other analytics like
        "related terms"
    - have topic combos on analytics page link to displaying those tweets

Share w/Woycheck to put out to world!


give user the option to view graph at multiple scales
 - just need to change its width and update it
Other analytics/visualizations like % of each term that shows up in cross-search tweets?
 - average tps per topic
 
If tweet error, only do one test search to check if resolved,
   instead of trying to search for all topics

Dream:
BUG: phone portrait->landscape, nav won't align when enlarged
monitor timing throughout app and eliminate animations if slow
use tweet timing data to generate more accurate + historical info
ability to show + hide trending topics on mobile

animate tps graph instead of complete redraw
- would need to handle re-scales somehow
- http://blog.visual.ly/creating-animations-and-transitions-with-d3-js/

reduce memory usage through tweet garbage collection

USES:
- monitor total convers traf on diff topics
- read & monitor complex topics
- see which topics are more related ("romney | obama" + big bird)
