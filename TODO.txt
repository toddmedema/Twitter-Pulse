TODO
let users filter (ie "show only tweets that contain" then
    a checkmark list of all tweet searches)
    - will need to restructure tweet storage so that
        tweet content isn't deleted once displayed
    - might also enable other analytics like
        "related terms"

make buttons, etc bigger on small displays
- try using width: -webkit-calc(350px - 50px); for noJS scaling

Share w/Woycheck to put out to world!

for performance, use counters to keep track of tweet
    #'s and limit array sizes (except tps history)

BUG: if the page is created small, nav won't align when enlarged
- phone switch portrait to landscape

give user the option to view graph at multiple scales
 - just need to change its width and update it
Other analytics/visualizations like % of each term that shows up in cross-search tweets?
 - average tps per topic
 
If tweet error, only do one test search to check if resolved,
   instead of trying to search for all topics

Dream:
use tweet timing data to generate historical info
Have links in tweets be actual links
ability to show + hide trending topics on mobile

animate tps graph instead of complete redraw
- would need to handle re-scales somehow
