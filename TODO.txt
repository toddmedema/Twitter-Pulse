TODO
have topic combos on analytics page link to displaying those tweets



**Dream**
use webworker for twitter data retreival, only send back once it's all there
- http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-html5mobile4/index.html
CSS explodes if you try to print it!

UI+new features:
hovering (or clicking?) a monitored topic highlights it in the chart
- have a UI variable .hover = (search # || -1)
- in UI update, if .hover != -1, set color to rgba(x,x,x,.5) unless = .hover
- call UI.update when topic clicked
BUG: phone portrait->landscape, nav won't align when enlarged
ability to show + hide trending topics on mobile
use tweet timing data to generate more accurate/historical info
show average tps per topic combo (track combo start time)
give user the option to view graph at multiple scales
 - just need to change its width and update it
analyze tweets for related/frequent terms
create a relational index to measure how related the terms are
- base off # of tweets they share vs total
 
Performance:
(cpu profile: analytics page ~20%cpu, tweets ~10%cpu)
(RAM: 270k tw = 90mb, 170k = 50mb, 10k = 10mb)
animate tps graph instead of complete redraw
- would need to handle re-scales somehow
- http://blog.visual.ly/creating-animations-and-transitions-with-d3-js/
don't completely delete analytics table on redraw - use IDs
- would that actually be faster?
- would prevent destroying people's highlights
reduce long-term memory usage through tweet garbage collection
If tweet error, only do one test search to check if resolved,
   instead of trying to search for all topics
monitor timing throughout app and eliminate animations if slow
better handling of color# css - hardcoded?


USES:
- monitor total convers traf on diff topics
- read & monitor complex topics
- see which topics are more related ("romney | obama" + big bird)
